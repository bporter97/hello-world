Hello Everyone!

This repository is meant to store class and method signatures, programming language structures, and initializations for various programming languages. This readme also contains a little bit out myself :)

My name is Blake Porter and I have been programming since I was 13 years old. Up until a year or two ago, I had never really considered that this would be a possible career path for me, however now I am certain that this is what I want to do! I am 21 years old, and currently living in Austin, Texas. I still have a long way to go in terms of becoming a half decent developer, however thanks to GitHub and the support from my beautiful and amazing girlfriend, I am confident that I can learn and become a competent and desirable developer, even if they are just side projects.
