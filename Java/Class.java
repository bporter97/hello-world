//When A class is defined in Java, a new type comes into being.
//The new type definition can then be used to instantiate (create instances of) one or more objects of that new type.

/*The class definition provides a blueprint that describes the data contained within,
and the behavior of objects instantiated according to the new type.
*/

//Class Defintion
class MyClassName
{
  /*An object is said to have state and behavior. At any instant in time,
  the state of an object is determined by the values stored in
  its variables and its behavior is determined by its methods.
